# Tony's Pizza Catering Application

This application keeps track of the catering orders for Tony's Pizza.

## Ruby Version

2.2.2

## System Dependencies

Developer tools (XCode on OS X, build-essential package on Ubuntu, Ruby DevKit on Windows)

## Configuration

No custom configuration is required for this app

## First-Time Setup

1. Clone the code from GitHub using `git clone https://github.com/elizabrock/tonys_pizza.git`
2. Read this README ;)
3. Install dependencies using `bundle`.
4. Run `ruby bin\setup` to create databases locally for development and testing, copy the database schema to your local databases, and import sample data for running the app in development.
5. Turn on the server with `rails server`
6. (optional) Run `rake` (see The Test Suite, below). If everything is set up correctly, rake will pass.


Note: To turn off the rails server when you are done, go to the command-line where the rails server is running and type in Ctrl-C (that means hold down the "Ctrl" key and the "c" key at the same time, and then let go).


## The Test Suite

This application was developed with Test-Driven Development, using the MiniTest testing tools that come with Rails by default.

Run the test suite with `rake`.
